	- Re-wrote parts of the code for running Javascript and calling native
	  C methods from Javascript. Thwonk now runs Javascript again. Patch
	  is halfway finished. New to keep an eye on the security implications
	  of switching to Spidermonkey 1.8.5, e.g. File

	- Refactored database initial starting data, it was overly complex

	- Added start of test suite, can test mail injection and javascript
	  execution

* 26th Dec 2011

	- Patched build and code to work with Spidermonkey 1.8.5 (untested)

	- Updated some docs and todos

	- Patched code where some params weren't getting correctly passed to
	  functions, i.e. msgqueue.c line 382 setErrType(WEXITSTATUS(status))
	  was incorrect, as setErrType() should only have been passed in a ERRTYPE enum

* 14th Dec 2011

	- Tweaked code for public release
	- Removed 2006 to 2011 change logs

* 2006 to 2009
