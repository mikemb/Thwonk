How to Install THWONK 
=====================
Author: Mike Bennett (mike@thwonk.com)

Hi welcome to THWONK!

In this document I explain how you can setup THWONK on a Unix server
and integrate it into your mail system.

If you have questions or suggestions you can visit:
     http://www.thwonk.com
for further help and assistance.

This help file is aimed at those of you who are building THWONK from
source code.

BTW if you'd like to help us get THWONK working on other platforms,
such Windows servers, please get in contact.

Enjoy,
Mike

0. Building THWONK
==================
THWONK consists of two main components:

1) frontend website, which runs on Django with python

2) backend daemons, which process incoming messages, run javascripts, etc.

THWONK backend comes with standard configure and make scripts.


1. Requirements
===============

THWONK requires that the installation server has the following
programs and libraries:

- web server such as Apache or Lighttpd 1.4+

- postfix or equivalent MTA

- database currently MySQL 5.0+

- Django with python mysqldb

- mailutils 1.1+ development library (libmailbox) and headers - available
  at http://www.gnu.org/software/mailutils

- spidermonkey 1.6+ development library (libjs) and headers - available
  at http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey (see section 7 below for details)
  
Note: The version numbers listed above aren't fixed. We know that
THWONK works with at least that version of the programs and libraries. In
most cases it'll probably work with earlier versions.


2. Database
===========

THWONK currently only supports MySQL. If you're interested you could easily
extend THWONK to support other database, such as PostgreSQL.

When you compile thwonk you'll need to edit codewide.h to setup the database
username (SET_DBUSER), password (SET_DBPWORD) and whether its accessed via a
socket (SET_DBSOCKET) or server (SET_DBDOMAIN).


4. Mail Integration
===================

mailinject should be setup with:

- chmod 4755 mailinject as root user, set the sticky bit on it. This is
  needed because mailinject chroots to the directory you set (SET_JAIL)
  in codewide.h then switches to the user nobody before running (SET_RUNASUSER)

- a world writeable tmp folder should be in the folder mailinject chroots to

- mailinject should be added to a .forward file which should have the
  following line:
		|/home/thwonk/thwonk/bin/mailinject

- the .forward file should be in an account that can receive email, and
  depending on whether THWONK is running for one email address, or for
  many, you may need to edit your mail server setup, e.g. in postfix I've
  for a development server I've used (where thwonk.com is set to 127.0.0.1):
    virtual_alias_domains = thwonk.com
    virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual

- in codewide.h set SET_DOMAIN to the domain that thwonk receives mail on,
  e.g. if mail is sent to test@play.thwonk.com then SET_DOMAIN should be
  play.thwonk.com

 
7. Compiling SpiderMonkey
=========================

* Using OSSP's SpiderMonkey *

Rather than having to mess around compiling SpiderMonkey you could use
OSSP's cleaned up build of spidermonkey which is available at:
		http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/js
This version uses an autotools build env and automatically installs headers
and libraries in suitable places.

* Building Standard Version *

When you're compiling spidermonkey I cannot recommend strongly
enough that you compile in it non-DEBUG/TEST mode and turn on compiler
optimizations. It makes a MASSIVE difference to how fast javascript rules
run. In js/src use (something like):

 make -f Makefile.ref BUILD_OPT=1 OPTIMIZER="-O3 -mtune=k8 -march=k8
 	-pipe -fomit-frame-pointer

You may need to change the build command line depending on the architecture
you are building on, i.e. you shouldn't set mtune to k8 unless you're
going to be running THWONK on an AMD 64 bit processor, and you definitely
shouldn't use march unless you know what it does.

To install your own version of spidermonkey copy the libjs file to a location
such as /usr/local/lib and the *.h/*.tbl files to /usr/local/include. Don't
forget you might need to add the path to the libjs to ld.so.conf (and run
ldconfing -v or put the path to libjs.so in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH).


8. Library Versions Confirmed To Work
=====================================
List of libraries that THWONK depends on, along with version numbers that
it works on.

- mailutils 1.2
- spidermonkey 1.6
