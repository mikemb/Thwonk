IMMEDIATE
=========
- tweaked msgqueue.c line 382, setErrType(WEXITSTATUS(status)) was incorrect, as setErrType()
  should only have been passed in a ERRTYPE enum. Test effects and patch to also record status

- in spidermonkey 1.8.5 JS_NewString is obsolete - tweaked to use JS_NewStringCopyZ, check 
  jsObjectThwonk_dummy() still works from javascript

- patched jsObjectThwonk_print to use JS_EncodeString rather than JS_GetStringBytes which is
  obsolete in recent spidermonkey version. Test whether works

- suspect there's a memory leak in jsObjectThwonk_message_sendMember, repeat calls could eat
  up memory on failure to successfully dbEscapeString (for example if body fails user and subject
  memory isn't freed)

- patched jsObjectThwonk_file_read and jsObjectThwonk_file_write to use JS_EncodeString, check do
  they work


NEXT
====
- move hardcoded config options to external file and database


SHORT TERM
==========
- move to holding values returned by queries in my_ulonglong rather than long

- add code for parsing mail headers and body

- check how to do msg rate flow for mail server so rate flow can be
  controlled on mail server

- maybe remove DEFINES and replace with enum, will improve code checks


LONG TERM
=========
- Use a generic layer for talking to database so could use PostgreSQL
  or another database instead of only MySQL

- Port to Windows
