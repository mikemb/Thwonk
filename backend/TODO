SHORT TERM
==========
- move to holding values returned by queries in my_ulonglong rather than long

- add code for parsing mail headers and body

- check how to do msg rate flow for mail server so rate flow can be
  controlled on mail server

- maybe remove DEFINES and replace with enum, will improve code checks

- move hardcoded config options to external file and database


LONG TERM
=========
- Use a generic layer for talking to database so could use PostgreSQL
  or another database instead of only MySQL

- Port to Windows
